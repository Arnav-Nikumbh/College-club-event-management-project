# College-club-event-management-project

In modern academic institutions, student clubs play an essential role in fostering holistic 
development by promoting leadership, collaboration, and co-curricular engagement. 
However, as clubs expand in both size and activity, managing their operations through 
manual processes becomes increasingly difficult. Challenges such as disorganized event 
planning, inefficient record-keeping, and lack of centralized communication often hinder 
productivity and transparency. 
To address these issues, we developed UniVentâ€”a comprehensive Club Management 
System designed specifically to cater to the needs of student clubs at the institutional level. 
UniVent aims to streamline various aspects of club administration, including member 
management, event scheduling, participation tracking, and approval workflows. By providing 
a unified digital platform for students, club coordinators, and administrators, the system 
enhances collaboration and accountability across all levels. 
UniVent is built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the 
frontend, and integrates a MySQL database with Flask on the backend to ensure efficient data 
handling and secure transactions. The project not only applies core database principles like 
ER modeling, normalization, and relational schema design but also demonstrates how these 
concepts can solve real-world challenges faced in everyday college life.
